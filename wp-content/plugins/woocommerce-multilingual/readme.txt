== Description ==

This 'glue' plugin makes it possible to run fully multilingual e-commerce sites using [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) and [WPML](http://wpml.org).

= Key Features =

* Translate all WooCommerce products (simple, variable, grouped, external)
* Easy translation management for products, categories and attributes
* Keeps the same language through the checkout process
* Sends emails to clients and admins in their language
* Allows inventory tracking without breaking products into languages
* Enables running a single WooCommerce store with multiple currencies

= Compatibility with WooCommerce Extensions =

Almost every WooCommerce store uses some extensions. WooCommerce Multilingual is fully compatible with popular extensions, including:

* [WooCommerce Bookings](https://wpml.org/documentation/woocommerce-extensions-compatibility/translating-woocommerce-bookings-woocommerce-multilingual/)
* [WooCommerce Table Rate Shipping](https://wpml.org/documentation/woocommerce-extensions-compatibility/translating-woocommerce-table-rate-shipping-woocommerce-multilingual/)
* [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://wpml.org/documentation/woocommerce-extensions-compatibility/translating-woocommerce-subscriptions-woocommerce-multilingual/)
* [WooCommerce Product Add-ons](https://wpml.org/documentation/woocommerce-extensions-compatibility/translating-woocommerce-product-add-ons-woocommerce-multilingual/)
* [WooCommerce Tab Manager](https://wpml.org/documentation/woocommerce-extensions-compatibility/translating-woocommerce-tab-manager-woocommerce-multilingual/)

Looking for other extensions that are tested and compatible with WPML? See the complete [list of WooCommerce extensions that are compatible with WPML](https://wpml.org/documentation/woocommerce-extensions-compatibility/).

= Usage Instructions =

For step by step instructions on setting up a multilingual shop, please go to [WooCommerce Multilingual Manual](http://wpml.org/documentation/related-projects/woocommerce-multilingual/) page.

After installing, follow the steps of the *setup wizard* to translate the store pages, configure what attributes should be translated, enable the multi-currency mode and other settings.

Then, continue to the 'Products' and any categories, tags and attributes that you use.

When you need help, go to [WooCommerce Multilingual support forum](http://wpml.org/forums/topic-tag/woocommerce/).

= Downloads =

This version of WooCommerce Multilingual works with WooCommerce > 2.1

You will also need [WPML](http://wpml.org), together with the String Translation and the Translation Management modules, which are part of the [Multilingual CMS](http://wpml.org/purchase/) package.

= Minimum versions for WPML and modules =

WooCommerce Multilingual checks that the following versions of WPML and their components are active:

* WPML Multilingual CMS       - 3.4
* WPML String Translation     - 2.0
* WPML Translation Management - 2.2
* WPML Media                  - 2.1

Without having all these running, WooCommerce Multilingual will not be able to run.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.9 or later
* PHP version 5.6 or later
* MySQL version 5.6 or later

* WooCommerce 2.1 or later
* WPML Multilingual CMS 3.4 or later
* WPML String Translation 2.0 or later
* WPML Translation Management 2.2 or later
* WPML Media 2.1 or later

= WordPress automatic installation =
In your WordPress dashboard, go to the Plugins section and click 'Add new'.

= WPML Installer =
If you're already using WPML on your site, in your WordPress dashboard, go to the Plugins section, click 'Add new' and go to the 'Commercial' tab.

= Manual Installation =
1. Upload 'woocommerce-multilingual' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

= Setup =
After installing the plugin either automatically or manually:

1. Follow the steps of the setup wizard for the basic required configuration
2. Translate existing content: products, attributes, permalink bases
3. Optionally, add secondary currencies

= Updating =
Once you installer WooCommerce Multilingual, the built in Installer works together with the WordPress automatic update built in logic to make the updating process as easy as it can be.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with other e-commerce plugins? =

No. This plugin is tailored for WooCommerce.

= What do I need to do in my theme? =

Make sure that your theme is not hard-coding any URL. Always use API calls to receive URLs to pages and you'll be fine.

= My checkout page displays in the same language =

In order for the checkout and store pages to appear translated, you need to create several WordPress pages and insert the WooCommerce shortcodes into them. You'll have to go over the [documentation](http://wpml.org/documentation/related-projects/woocommerce-multilingual/) and see that you performed all steps on the way.

= Can I have different urls for the store in the different languages? =

Yes. You can translate the product permalink base, product category base, product tag base and the product attribute base on the Store URLs section.

= Why do my product category pages return a 404 error? =

In this case, you may need to translate the product category base. You can do that on the Store URLs section.

= Can I set the prices in the secondary currencies? =

By default, the prices in the secondary currencies are determined using the exchange rates that you fill in when you add or edit a currency. On individual products, however, you can override this and set prices manually for the secondary currencies.

= Can I have separate currencies for each language? =

Yes. By default, each currency will be available for all languages, but you can customize this and disable certain currencies on certain languages.

= Is this plugin compatible with other WooCommerce extensions? =

WooCommerce Multilingual is compatible with all major WooCommerce extensions. We're continuously work on checking and maintaining compatibility and collaborate closely with the authors of these extensions.
